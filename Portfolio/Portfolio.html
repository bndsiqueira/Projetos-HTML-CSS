        <h3>First Try on Web Development</h3>

        <h3>"All-in-One Python Utility Tool"</h3>
        <p>Identify triangle types based on side lengths, 
          solve quadratic equations, validate dates, analyze CPF numbers (Brazilian individual registry), 
          convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin, count vowels, spaces, and other characters in a string, 
          calculate factorials, detect palindromes, analyze text length. I received an evaluative activity at my university that 
          asked me to complete only the first five tasks. I thought it would be a great idea to expand it a little.</p>

        <p>My portfolio is a personal project that showcases my skills and projects. It was built using HTML and CSS, 
          and it serves as a platform to present my work and experiences. It was the most complicated thing I coded and the most recent one.</p>
